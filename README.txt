- **FreelanceChain**
FreelanceChain is a decentralized platform designed to empower designers by enabling them to showcase their work, connect with clients, and receive secure paymentsâ€”all within a trustless, blockchain

Problem I am Solving:
I aim to address the challenge of limited access to secure and transparent financial systems in my community, especially for freelancers and small business owners. 
Many individuals struggle with trust issues, payment delays, and lack of proper infrastructure to support seamless transactions. 
By leveraging Celo's blockchain technology, I plan to create decentralized solutions that promote secure, fast, and transparent transactions. 
This will empower freelancers, entrepreneurs, and creatives to manage projects, receive payments, and build trust with clients locally and globally.
